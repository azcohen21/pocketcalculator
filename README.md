#sets menu text
        At line 2 I get the users operation. I used a variable for the text of the menu so that the menu code looks clean and can be updated quickly.
#get operation
        Takes user operation input
#Test for a valid operation
        Here I used a while loop to verify that the numbers the user input were valid menu choices. Invalid choice produce an error message and prompt the user to reenter. 
#confirm operation chosen    
        Here I used conditionals to confirm the user’s choice in text format
#set correct wording for operation and obtain inputs    
        I added an extra operation “exponentiation” so I wanted the wording to be clearer.
        #asking the user for the base number
                This is for exponentiation to use correct wording
        #asking the user for exponential number


        #asking the user for the first number


        #asking the user for second number


#run calculation
        Used conditionals to run correct operation and save answer as variable “result”
        I used a while loop to add error checking for division functionality to prevent division by zero.
        #add the numbers 


        #subtract the numbers


        #Multiply the numbers


        #Divide the numbers


#exponentiate the numbers
        Added an extra operation exponentiation
#print the result
print the result of the operation chosen by user

1. Use of iteration - added a while loop at the top in line 5. Added a while loop in line 14, line 53
2. Additional functionality - added exponential functionality in lines 58-60, added error checking for menu choice in line 14,15. Added error checking for division by zero in line 54, 55
